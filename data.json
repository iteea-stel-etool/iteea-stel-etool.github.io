The Bronze Age began with the discovery of copper and copper-based metals. The wide application of new agricultural technologies such as the sickle, plow, windmill, and irrigation enabled farmers to grow more food. Sustained technological advancement caused many people to migrate from farms to developing towns and cities. Other influential developments in this age included weaving machines and the spinning wheel, which advanced the making of cloth.

The Middle Ages saw the development of many technological devices that produced long-lasting effects on technology and society, such as the waterwheel and the magnetic compass. In some form all of these devices are still being used today, although they have been greatly modified from earlier designs. The Renaissance was also an important era of development in the history of technology.
